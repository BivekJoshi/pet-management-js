          Welcome to the Yejus Paw. Our range of products available are to suit
          dogs of all shapes and sizes-from Terriers to Great Danes and
          everything in between! We have developed our own product ranges and
          have hand-picked brands that offer products of the highest quality and
          that all have one thing in common; We’d be happy to feed the products
          to or use them on our own dogs.
